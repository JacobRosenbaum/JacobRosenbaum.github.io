                            Hello! My name is Jacob Rosenbaum. Glad you navigated to my site. This is my first ever deployment and I'm so excited to dive deep into coding.
                            </p>    
                            <p>
                            I graduated from the U of M with a a Business degree and found that coding is vastly more interesting. I plan to combine my business soft skills with my coding technical skills to lead long and succesful (and fun!) web development career!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Outside of work and school, I really enjoy sports. I played and coached baseball my whole life, and I'm a big Twins fan. 
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                             I was born and raised in Minneapolis, and I love it here. I spoent two years living in Kansas, out that was awesome, but Minnesota is my home. I also love to travel, my goal is to see as many places as possible. A dream of mine is to visit all 7 continents. So far I have been to 3 (North America, Europe, and Australia)   
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Thanks again for visiting my site. Next time you come, I plan on being much more proficient and dynamic in my coding, so this page will look a lot cooler!   
                            </p>
