                <img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/headshot.jpg"> Hello! My name is Jacob Rosenbaum. Glad you navigated to my site. This is my first ever deployment and I'm so excited to dive deep into coding.
                <p>
                    I graduated from the U of M with a a Business degree and found that coding is vastly more interesting. I plan to combine my business soft skills with my coding technical skills to lead long and succesful (and fun!) web development career!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was born and raised in Minneapolis, and I love it here. I spent two years living in Kansas, and that was awesome, but Minnesota is my home. I also love to travel, my goal is to see as many places as possible. A dream of mine is to visit all 7 continents.
                    So far I have been to 3 (North America, Europe, and Australia)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thanks again for visiting my site. Next time you come, I plan on being much more proficient and dynamic in my coding, so this page will look a lot cooler!
