# Welcome to my BootCamp Projects Repository!

### In here, you will find all of the cool stuff I made during my time at the University of Minnesota Coding Bootcamp!

### Basic Portfolio
This is the original rendition of my portfolio and also the first project I ever completed. It was made solely using HTML and CSS. There is absolutely no UI and obviously a lot left to be desired (which I will tackle down the line).

### Bootstrap Portfolio
I took my original design for my portfolio and updated the UI using Bootstrap. This allows the user to shrink the screen and the site responsively shrinks with it. A very neccessary and useful tool. 

### Code Quiz
I developed a 5 question Spongebob Squarepants quiz. The user is allowed 90 seconds to answer all 5 of their questions, however, if they answer a question wrong, 15 seconds is subtracted from the timer. This project was developed using HTML, CSS, BootStrap and JavaScript. It's the first project I made using JavaScript. 

### Workday Planner
This project allows the user to write down notes and save them to local storage. They are given 8 time slots throughout the workday to write down reminders, plans, notes, etc... When the user refreshes the page, the notes will still be there. I used Moment.js so that the time and date is correctly displayed each time the user opens the site. This was developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, and Moment.js. 

### Weather Dashboard
This site allows the user to search for any city in the world to figure out the current temperature, wind speed, and climate. It also gives the user a dynamic 5 day forecast. This is the first project where I used AJAX calls to interact with APIs (I used the Open Weather API)

### GitHub Profile PDF Generator
This project was my first interaction with node, so the deployed website will not show the complete functionality because Github is not compatible with Back-End languages. In the terminal, the user is prompted for their GitHub username and favorite color. Once answered, Node will immediately generate a PDF GitHub profile. I used the Inquirer Node package to receive the user input. I also used the Axios package to interact with the Github API and retrieve the user's profile picture, and the amount of public repos, followers, following, and GitHub Stars they have.

### Team Profile Generator: 
This project also uses Node, so the deployed website will once again not show the complete functionality. In the terminal, the Inquirer package prompts the user to build their team. It will ask for their manager's Name, ID, Office Number, and Email. It will then ask who the user would like to add next, either an Engineer or an Intern. If the user chooses and Intern, it will ask for their Name, ID, Email, and School. IF they choose and Engineer, it will ask for their Name, Email, ID, and Github. The user can add as many team members as they would like. Once finished, node will generate the HTML for the site complete with Bootstrap cards for each employee.
