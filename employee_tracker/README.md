# Welcome to My Employee Tracker!

### Functionality

This app is designed entirely to be used out of the terminal. The idea is the user is able to view, add, and update employees from a MySQL employee database. 
I used the inquirer package to prompt the user questions asking what they would like to do, then created functions for each. After each function, I call the oringinal "start" function to keep the app moving, this function uses a switch statement to call the approatite function for adding, viewing, or updating.


### Technologies

This app was developed using VS Code and MySQL database.I used JavaScipt, Node (inqiurer, mysql, consol.table, and cfonts packages), and MySQL database.
